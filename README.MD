## Prompt

I want to create an open-world RPG video game for my own use. In this game, we spawn in a fantasy world, and every goal we will have in the game will be determined by AI. We encounter random characters, and we can talk with all of them, and quests are created during the game by a small LLM.
I use a function named generate_response that takes as input a string and in return prints the answer as a stream.

How would you recommend me to do my game?
